I thought I try something new and actually save and post about cool, fun and amazing things I found on the world wide web. Hopefully if will be a recurring thing. First thing out is Rainyday

> [Rainyday](https://github.com/maroslaw/rainyday.js) is a JavaScript library that simulates rain falling on a glass surface

Go chek out the demos, I got stuck staring at them. 

* [Demo 1](http://maroslaw.github.io/rainyday.js/demo1.html)
* [Demo 2](http://maroslaw.github.io/rainyday.js/demo2.html)
