Doing the short and tiny thing again and giving a shout out to [GoldieBlox](http://www.goldieblox.com/), a toy that I hope will conquer the world. This is from their homepage:

>At GoldieBlox, our goal is to get girls building. Weâ€™re here to help level the playing field in every sense of the phrase. By tapping into girls' strong verbal skills, our story + construction set bolsters confidence in spatial skills while giving young inventors the tools they need to build and create amazing things.

Basically it's a toy for girls that's about creating and thinking to inspire them to do stuff themselves. Awesome!
