I'm starting to get slightly nervous now. Decided that I was going to hold a talk at [Geek Girl Meetup Oresund](http://geekgirlmeetup.com/oresund/) and now I have to do it. Since I seems to be unable to hold lectures and lessons without knowing monumentally more than what I'm actually going to talk about, I have quite a lot of work to do.

I have named the talk "How to go from idea to webapp in 15 minutes", or something like it, and it is about how to set up grunt, SASS, and JavaScript structure in under 20 minutes. And also, the will be pictures of kittens, probably.

I hope someone shows up and I hope I do great and that the kittens are cute.
