I don't like the idea of making a student feel confused and uneasy. I want the learning process to be pleasant, and preferably without tears and frustration. 

I once had a boss that said I was in danger of coddling the trainees I was in charge of then. And I've thought a lot about that since then. Was I, really? And would he really have said that to a man? (He called me a "mother hen").

Is it better for the student to make sure they take steps on their own, give them a small piece of information and then let them find their own way? Or is it better to make a safe space, and raise the starting point, so to speak.

My instinct is usually the latter. To create great material and try to fix what I hated when I learned. I don't want anyone to feel crappy about themselves just because they don't understand. I really hate that feeling myself.

Is that being coddling, and if so, is that a bad thing?
